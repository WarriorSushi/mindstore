_Automated 30-min improvement cycles by Frain_

## 2026-03-23 17:29 UTC — ⌘K Command Palette
- **Research**: Modern knowledge management UX patterns (Notion, Linear, Raycast, Obsidian)
- **Finding**: Command palette (⌘K) is the #1 power-user UX pattern across all modern knowledge apps — instant access to search + navigation from anywhere
- **Implemented**:
  - New `CommandPalette` component (`src/components/CommandPalette.tsx`)
  - Cmd+K / Ctrl+K keyboard shortcut opens full-app overlay
  - Searches memories via `/api/v1/search` with 200ms debounce
  - Navigate to any page by typing its name (fuzzy filter on 9 pages)
  - Full keyboard navigation: ↑↓ arrows, Enter to select, Esc to close
  - Search icon added to mobile header for touch access
  - ⌘K hint button in desktop sidebar footer
  - Matches MindStore dark UI (violet accents, rounded cards, backdrop blur)
- **Branch**: `frain/improve` (commit `ffb66a6`)
