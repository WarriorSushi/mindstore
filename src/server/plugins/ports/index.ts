/**
 * Plugin Ports — Portable logic modules
 *
 * Each port extracts core business logic from a plugin's route file,
 * making it framework-agnostic and reusable.
 *
 * All ports use namespaced exports to avoid collisions
 * (many ports export ensureInstalled, runImport, etc.).
 *
 * Shared utilities:
 *   shared-vectors — k-means clustering, cosine similarity, keyword extraction
 *   plugin-config  — ensurePluginInstalled, getPluginConfig, savePluginConfig
